      outline:
          * 1. histogram mean / var (supp. 11-year cycle), some period - difference between max and min, -> evolving, testing against surrogates 
          * 2. variability in other scales, show amplitude of yearly cycle (histogram, evolving?)
          * 3. other station - HAM, POTS - something
          * supp: 4, 11-year cycle
          * histo means/var bez surr, seasons z toho v supp, evolving s MF surr, overall - DJF jeden obrazok, FT, AR surr v supp, 
          * overall variability doteraz, teraz SAT amplitude 1-year cycle,  evolving kratsi PRG, asi histo k tomu do jedneho obr
